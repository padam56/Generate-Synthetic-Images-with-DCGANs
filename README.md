# Generate-Synthetic-Images-with-DCGANs-in-Keras
In this project, I have used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to build and train a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with Keras to generate images of fashionable clothes based on the fashion MNIST datasest.

## Implementation:
- DCGAN based genetated imges over 12 epocs
